A Servant of Two Masters was the first play I ever teched with Tech Crew! After being handed Tech Crew's god-knows-how-old dying Macbook, I taught myself QLab, and collected a playlist of music "piratey" enough, scrolling through the script to find audio that would fit.

The show had an in-the-round setup, and so we had speakers in opposite corners, lights in the other, with cables expertly taped above doors. I also helped with focusing the lights.

In between tech rehersals in the morning, we had a lot of time to spare. As it turns out, if you touch the right region in the settings menu of the lighting desk, you unlock a game! Admittedly, the game takes more perseverance than skill to get a highscore in, but I still made it onto the leaderboard of fame.
